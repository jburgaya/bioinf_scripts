**concatenate_aligned_genes.py**
After running panarro_msa with the modification of selecting just a subset of core genes (https://github.com/microbial-pangenomes-lab/panaroo) I got an output directory with the single genes aligned. The script is used to concatenate all genes into a single (subset) core gene multiple sequence alignment.
